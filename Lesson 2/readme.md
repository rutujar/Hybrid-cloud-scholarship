# Lesson 2: Journey to the modern Hybird cloud

# Why are Hybrid Cloud Engineers needed?

* Here are the two main reasons for the difficulties:

* The first one is a lack of organizational readiness. Having a cloud-focused model affects many aspects of the organization outside of the tech-side, like people and processes. Each business has to prepare for these impacts during their Cloud adoption plans.

* Second, adding technology doesn't necessarily add value unless there's a clear goal or outcome to be achieved.

* To avoid these challenges, you need to focus on business requirements first. Once you've figured out the business requirements, you can then match those requirements to technologies that help achieve those goals or requirements. Then, you need the right mix of skills to carry the plan out.

* This is where the Hybrid Cloud Engineer comes in. The engineer is needed to help organizations successfully plan and implement their cloud transformation.

* A hybrid cloud engineer can bring in new technologies quickly, analyze competition, and create comparisons between old and new ways of doing business. Hybrid cloud engineers are able to modernize any organization, but they will find every business increasingly requiring hybrid capabilities to compete on a global scale.

# What does a Hybrid Cloud Engineer do?

* A hybrid cloud engineer can design, create, operate, and manage different types of workloads across multiple clouds and infrastructure providers.

* The engineer should be able to:

* Consult and plan with business stakeholders

* Successfully execute this plan

* Validate outcomes through their technical skillset

* The Hybrid Cloud Engineer helps organizations determine their readiness, and make suggestions if an organization isn't ready yet. One of the most important things to check is if business requirements are clearly defined. This is done through Service Level Agreements, or SLAs, need to be completely documented and enforceable. This is what you're going to use to choose the right infrastructure for every service.

* This is followed by implementation.

* Implementation involves planning and executing migration. This involves a few things like refactoring applications for the best possible Total Cost of Ownership, or TCO, and Return On Investment, or ROI. Once complete, the technical and organizational infrastructure needs to be continuously monitored to check if performance expectations that were created in the SLAs are met.
